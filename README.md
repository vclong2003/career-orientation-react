# ‚ùó This project has been abandoned

The purpose of this proposal is to solve the problem of career orientation for high school students in Vietnam. When there is too little reliable information, too much chaos, and a lack of environment to experience, career guidance has inevitably become a concern for pupils. As a result, we provide the solution of a career website with complete objective, concise, and accurate information; an exchange environment between high school and university students; and a game model that simulates future employment to help you get the clearest picture of your future major.
